# Python-Series-11-List-Slicing

In Python, list slicing is a common practice and it is the most used technique for programmers to solve efficient problems. Consider a python list, In-order to access a range of elements in a list, you need to slice a list. One way to do this is to use the simple slicing operator i.e. colon(:)

With this operator, one can specify where to start the slicing, where to end, and specify the step. List slicing returns a new list from the existing list.
